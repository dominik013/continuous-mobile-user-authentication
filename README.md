# Continuous Mobile User Authentication using Combined Biometric Traits

This repository contains the data for the publication of the journal, which summarizes the findings of my masters thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - Campus Hagenberg.

It contains three seperate sub-projects:
+ Recorder Android application which is recording data used by the system (touch / accelerometer data)
+ The code for training the Hidden Markov Model in Python using hmmlearn (the used database can be found in this folder)
+ Verifier Android application used for importing the previously generated model and making predictions on new inputs
